# 2D Rabbit Escape
A Single-Player Arcade-Style Game Set on a Carrot Farm

Overview
2D Rabbit Escape is a single-player arcade-style game set on a sprawling carrot farm. The player takes on the role of a mischievous rabbit with a big appetite for carrots and a clever mind for escaping trouble. The objective is to navigate through a complex maze of carrot patches, hidden tunnels, and farm obstacles while gathering a designated number of carrots. However, the rabbit isn’t alone—an alert and determined farmer is patrolling the farm, ready to catch any trespassing rabbit in the act. The player must use strategy, quick thinking, and well-timed power-ups to outsmart the farmer and make a clean escape.

Objective
The main goal of the game is to:

Collect a required number of carrots scattered throughout the maze.
Avoid capture by the farmer.
Successfully reach the exit after collecting enough carrots.
Premise
A hungry rabbit has ventured onto a carrot farm, tempted by the sight and smell of fresh, juicy carrots. However, the farmer is not too happy about uninvited guests. As the rabbit sneaks through the maze of the farm, it must grab as many carrots as possible while staying out of the farmer’s sight. The rabbit needs to be fast, clever, and strategic to avoid the farmer's grasp and make it out with a full belly.

Gameplay Mechanics
Movement
The player controls the rabbit using arrow keys or touch controls.
The rabbit can move in all four cardinal directions (up, down, left, and right).
The rabbit’s movement is quick but slower than the farmer’s base speed, making strategic pathing essential.
Carrot Collection
Carrots are scattered throughout the maze.
Each collected carrot increases the player’s score and brings them closer to meeting the carrot quota.
Some carrots may be placed in high-risk areas, requiring careful planning to collect.
Farmer Patrol
The farmer actively moves through the maze on a set patrol pattern.
The farmer responds dynamically to the rabbit's location.
If the farmer spots the rabbit, he will chase it until the rabbit manages to escape his line of sight or find a hiding spot.
Hiding Spots
Certain parts of the maze, such as tall grass or hollow logs, allow the rabbit to hide from the farmer.
If the rabbit reaches a hiding spot while being chased, the farmer will lose track of the rabbit, and the chase will end.
Power-ups
Special power-ups are hidden throughout the maze. When collected, they give the rabbit temporary advantages, such as:

Speed Boost: Temporarily increases the rabbit's movement speed, making it easier to outrun the farmer.
Invisibility: Allows the rabbit to avoid detection by the farmer for a short period.
Decoy: Drops a fake rabbit to distract the farmer.
Consequences
Capture
If the rabbit is caught by the farmer, the game ends immediately, and the player loses.
Time Pressure
Some levels may have a soft time limit, adding more pressure to complete the objective quickly.
Win Condition
The player wins by:

Collecting the required number of carrots.
Successfully escaping through the designated exit without being caught.
Inspiration
2D Rabbit Escape draws inspiration from classic arcade games like Pac-Man, incorporating a similar maze-navigation style with a modern twist. The game combines the thrill of collecting items with the strategic tension of avoiding capture, offering a balance of fast-paced action and thoughtful pathfinding.
